Docker is a tool where it allows you to run your application in a 
container which is a small lightweight and portable environment 
that includes everything your app needs 

Docker image is like class and docker container are like objects of that class 

Docker image are blueprints that contains the code and everything the code 
requires to run ( OS , libraries etc)

a docker container is a running instance of a docker image 
it like taking the blueprint(image) and building a live , working
app from it 

cmds to list all local images 
docker images 
docker rmi <image_name> 
docker image prune (remove unused images , prunign of tree)
docker buuld -t <image_name>

port binding 
docker run -p <host port> : <containerport> <img>
set env variables 
docker run -r <var_name> = <var_vale> <container_name/id>

docker start <container_name>
docker stop <container_name> 

docker image is formed of layer , the way intructions are to be performed 
each layer represents a layer int eh dockerfile
(like installing a package , copying file etc)

container - layer 1 - layer 2 - base layer 

when a new version of image is available then old layers are not installed 
only the new ones are installed and stacked on top of old ones 

Port Binding , 
the container ports are different from the computer ports 
so when a port eg 2020 is occupied in the computer ,then too we can use 
container port as 2020 , while binding contianer port 2020 with other free port
of the computer 


Docker vs Virtual machine 
it can be thought of as , virtual machine being the a solo ship with its own engine , that is a separate 
entit itself running independently , having its own resources and access to processor 

while docker can be thought of as a container in a ship that is it works int he same environment as other 
but it has its own boundries 
docker does the virtualization at the application layer , that is the interaction of user with the services
virtual machine virtualizes the kernel itself 

docker was built o linux based systems , so most of the images are based on OS itself , to solve this we use docker desktop 

it adds a light weight hypervisor layer over the system which internally ses a lightweight linus distribution 
this allows us to run our continaer on our systems
